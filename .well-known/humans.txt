/* PHILOSOPHY */

Why Ternary?
  - Richer than binary
  - Models three-way decisions
  - Interesting emergent properties
  - Inspired by music theory

Design Principles:
  - Simplicity - Core primitive is one line
  - Composability - Build complex from simple
  - Purity - Functional programming
  - Offline-first - No network dependencies
  - Memory-safe - Garbage collected
  - Type-friendly - Contracts available

Use Cases:
  - Quantitative Finance
  - Statistical Modeling
  - Machine Learning
  - Monte Carlo Simulations
  - Game Theory
  - Research & Education

/* FUN FACTS */

- The entire core is ~160 lines
- Tests are probabilistic (they can "fail" randomly!)
- Name plays on "bet" + "lang"
- Inspired by coin flips but uses three-sided coins
- Created during exploration of ternary logic
- Public domain - truly free

/* RANDOM QUOTE */

"All models are wrong, but some are useful." - George Box

In betlang, we embrace uncertainty.
Every bet is a model of reality.
Some bets are more useful than others.
All bets are probabilistic.

🎲 Happy betting! 🎲
